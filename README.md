# Veterinary Doctor Portfolio

## A modern, responsive front-end web application built with React.js and Chakra UI

This project is a professional portfolio website for a veterinary doctor, developed to showcase the doctor's services and allow clients to easily book appointments. The app was built using React.js (JavaScript) and Chakra UI for the design.

The portfolio contains the following sections:

- **Navbar** with a menu for easy navigation across the website;
- **Hero** section introducing the doctor;
- **About** Me section providing detailed background information;
- **Skills** section highlighting key professional expertise;
- **Services** section showcasing available veterinary services;
- **Contact Me** section where users can send inquiries.

Additionally, users can:

- **Book appointments** by clicking on the “Book now” button for any of the available services, which redirects them to a Booking page;
- **Submit booking forms** with personal and pet details, and have the data sent securely to the doctor's email using SendGrid's email service.

The project also ensures full responsiveness across mobile and tablet devices.
